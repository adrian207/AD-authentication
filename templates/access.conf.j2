# Comment line must start with "#", no space at front.
# Order of lines is important.
#
# When someone logs in, the table is scanned for the first entry that
# matches the (user, host) combination, or, in case of non-networked
# logins, the first entry that matches the (user, tty) combination.  The
# permissions field of that table entry determines whether the login will
# be accepted or refused.
# Format of the login access control table is three fields separated by a
# ":" character:
-:ALL EXCEPT {% for login in allow_users_groups %}{{login}} {% endfor %}:ALL
